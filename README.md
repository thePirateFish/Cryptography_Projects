Fall 2018

This repository includes the source code from three projects completed as 
coursework during the Fall 2018 semester.

Go projects:
vigenere - includes creating and breaking basic Vigenere encryption.

encrypt-auth - An implementation of a custom cryptographic specification 
using the AES cipher from the Go crypto library as a building block. CBC and
HMAC algorithms are implemented by hand. Also included is a padding attack
implementation on this protocol.
 
Python project:
This project contains detailed implementations of the Diffie-Hellman and 
Elgamal schemes, capable of a key strength of 1024 bits. Also included are
attacks on the DH protocol. One is a brute force attempt, and the efficient
version uses the Pollard's rho algorithm.
