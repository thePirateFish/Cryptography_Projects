This repository includes the source code from three projects completed as coursework during the Fall 2018 semester.
The work includes creating and breaking basic Vigenere encryption (Go), 
an implementation of a custom cryptographic specification and attacks on it (Go),
and detailed implementations of Diffie-Hellman and Elgamal schemes and attacks (Python).
